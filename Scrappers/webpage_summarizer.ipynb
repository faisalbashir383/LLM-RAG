However, Mr. Taabeen have done excellent job in securing our hotels during high demand season. Our entire stay at different locations was pleasant and an experience itself. Houseboat (Harmukh) recommended by Mr. Taabeen was excellent choice in our budget. Car and Driver (Mr. Adil) allocated to our trip was great too. We enjoyed our entire 6 days trip to Kashmir and brought lots of memories back home. I would highly recommend Kashmirani as one stop solution for your Kashmir Tour Planning. They are very honest and transparent in all their communications and commitments. Lots of love from Saumil and Family (Gujarat).”\\nMay 9, 2023\\n10.30 PM\\nSaumil Tripathi\\nIndia\\n“If you are planning to travel to Kashmir then you have landed on the right page.\\r\\nRecently, we had a group of 20 people who visited Kashmir for leisure and recreation and believe me you won’t find such a warm welcome and hospitality offered by team Kashmirani anywhere else.
